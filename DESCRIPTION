Description: The 'Chrome' browser <https://www.google.com/chrome/> has a headless mode
    which can be instrumented programmatically. Tools are provided to perform headless
    'Chrome' instrumentation on the command-line and will eventually provide support
    for the 'DevTools' instrumentation 'API' or the forthcoming 'phantomjs'-like higher-level
    'API' being promised by the development team.
